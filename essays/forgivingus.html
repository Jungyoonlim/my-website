        <h3>Forgiving Us</h3>
        <h5>June 4, 2022</h5>
        <p> Reality exists outside the realm of time and space, and there was love. Maybe, I am finally out of my mind — maybe I had too much granola yogurt for breakfast at the temple — too much of ascetic and hermit life has perhaps forever doomed me to a life of endless contemplation and no real action, but hey, I am writing this after 11 hours of meditation today, and I feel nothing but deeply grateful to be alive and typing this up at this moment. </p>
        <p> Before discussing the spacetime, yeah, I admit — I have been deluded enough to think that I could be some kind of harsh and uptight dharma for someone when I was the one that needed a dharma the most (I did go to the dharma talk today and it reaffirmed that I cannot be an overbearing dharma). </p>
        <p> Well, here’s some mathematical physics I picked up at Brown haha. Think of dynamical systems — the phase space. Basically, make a 2D plot that shows every possible state of the pendulum — every possible thing it could do in one graph. On the x-axis, plot the angle of the pendulum, and on the y-axis, its velocity. Each point would be a unique state of the system and it will tell you the behavior of the system over time. The angle — x-axis — would measure the angle it makes with the vertical line, and the angular velocity shows the rate at which the angle is changing and in this phase space, any point (θ, ω) shows a state of the pendulum. If the pendulum has friction, it slows down and stops — drawing itself inward and making slower swings, reaching the final state at rest to the fixed point at the fixed point attractor. The closed loop, however, makes periodic and predictable repeats. Each point uniquely identifies the complete state of the system — and the demon has also summoned — all the Laplacian future is predetermined for you. </p>
        <p>See Lorenz’s system, it has a sensitive dependence on initial conditions. There are three variables and plot the phase space in 3D. Take any point and see how it moves. They evolve together so far but start to diverge. They start from close points but end up in totally different trajectories. This is also completely deterministic — as long as you put the exact same initial conditions, you will end up with the same end result. Well, you know, very simple cases like tiny causes like a flay of butterfly’s wings in Brazil could have huge effects like the setting of a tornado in Texas. This means even tiny and insignificant choices I make now as a dumb 23-year-old can have huge consequences in my life. Does this not mean that I am forever doomed? If that’s the case, then I need to make sure that every single thing I do need to be right somehow (then I get frantic about, making the right choices, looking for the source for it, scouring for the answer) so I can prevent some huge regrettable future events. Then you start following the right tracks, listening to all the right people, talking to the right mentors, meeting the right person for a successful partnership and marriage, and getting on the right track that you ought to be on. Because there’s one right thing to do. In that case, I cannot allow any room for mistakes!</p>
        <p>I am grateful for my housemates. I have lived a nomadic and Spartan lifestyle in standard and rather brutalist dorms most of my life, but thanks to you, I think I have a much clearer picture of what my version of happiness looks like. Your wit and charm, and a killer sense of humor defused tension and filled me with joy. Your love of literature, films, nature, birds (blue jay!), and the humanities have markedly inspired me to live a rich inner life, deeply attuned and perceptive to the life around me. I will forever remember the care and love you have shown me past few months, and thanks for making our home warm and happy. I feel deeply blessed to be here and cohabit in this space with you all.</p>
        <p> And I am thankful to all my friends who come over for my dinner parties — nothing can be traded with the warm fuzzy feeling I have around the full table over homemade tomato basil gnocchi and banana bread.
            I am profoundly thankful for those who embraced my vulnerabilities and accepted my fragility. I would like to express deep appreciation for those who have taken a leap of faith in me. You have read me poems from the Romanticism period, let me cry on your shoulder and console me with warmth, introduced me to a fun romantic comedy show in times of sadness, and admonished me in a mild and gentle but earnest manner. There will never be enough words to convey how much you mean to me, and I will try my hardest to conduct all my behaviors in a way that show greater love and compassion toward you.
            I am thankful to my lovely younger brother for showing care and love. Your disposition and mine differ greatly — I lean more on the intense and hard-core side and you on the more chill and jolly side (DJ Jamie!), but I deeply appreciate you, and I am so honored to have you as my brother. I respect you a lot, learned quite a lot from you and was surprised by how mature you are, even if you are younger than I am!
            I owe much debt to my parents. I would describe the love you give me to be tsundere — which often, to be completely frank, perplexes me, but I understand the depth, and there is no word I can say but that I love you. The care you show cannot be put into standard terms, but I will be eternally grateful for what I have received, and I am forever in debt. By the way, I am doing okay, although Algebra is hard. hee.
            Last but not least, I send love and beg forgiveness to all those who entered and left my life, bearing my inadequacies and deficiencies in character. I am aware of my flaws, or at least — try to be aware, and I am trying hard to learn to be better from them. With all my shortcomings, each one of you has been generous enough to provide me with invaluable lessons and contributed to my flourishing in unique but monumental ways, so I am grateful.
            Thank you, and I hope you all have a wonderful Thanksgiving. </p>
